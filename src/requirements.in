# workarounds for pip 20.0.2's buggy dependency resolver
# which doesn't account for cross-package constraints: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020
# matplotlib pulls in the latest pyparsing, nibabel pulls in the latest packaging, and the two latests are in conflict.
# > ERROR: packaging 21.2 has requirement pyparsing<3,>=2.0.2, but you'll have pyparsing 3.0.5 which is incompatible.
# This forces the older pip, if the user has the older pip, to behave itself.
# This is to specially support users on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS; when Ubuntu 22.04 LTS comes out, this can be removed.

# 1.7.0>onnxruntime>=1.5.1 required `brew install libomp` on macOS.
# So, pin to >=1.7.0 to avoid having to ask users to install libomp.
# Avoid version 1.16.0 due to: https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox/issues/4225
# EI: also avoid 1.17.0, cannot be found by pip while building

# EI: pin to avoid ModuleNotFoundError: The `skimage.future.graph` submodule was moved to `skimage.graph` in v0.20. `ncut` was removed in favor of the identical function `cut_normalized`. Please update your import paths accordingly.
# EI: that happens with v0.21
