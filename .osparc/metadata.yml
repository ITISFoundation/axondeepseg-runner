  input_1:
    displayOrder: 1
    label: Image
    description: Axon image to segment
    type: data:*/*
  input_2:
    displayOrder: 2
    label: Modality
    description:
     Type of acquisition to segment. SEM, scanning electron microscopy. TEM, transmission electron microscopy. BF, bright field optical microscopy
    type: ref_contentSchema
    contentSchema: 
      title: Modality
      type: string
      enum: [SEM, TEM, BF]
  input_3:
    displayOrder: 3
    label: Size Pixel
    description: 
     Pixel size of the image(s) to segment, in micrometers. Single float number corresponding to the resolution of the image, i.e. the pixel size
    type: ref_contentSchema
    defaultValue: 0.07
    contentSchema: 
      title: Size Pixel
      type: number
      x_unit: micro-meter
  input_4:
    displayOrder: 4
    label: Overlap
    description: 
     Overlap value (in pixels) of the patches when doing the segmentation. 
     Higher values of overlap can improve the segmentation at patch borders, but also increase the segmentation time. 
    type: ref_contentSchema
    defaultValue: 48
    contentSchema: 
      title: Overlap
      type: integer
      minimum: 10
      maximum: 100
  input_5:
    displayOrder: 5
    label: Zoom Factor
    description: 
     When applying the model, the size of the segmentation patches relative to the image size will change according to this factor.
    type: ref_contentSchema
    defaultValue: 1
    contentSchema: 
      title: Zoom Factor
      type: number
  input_6:
    displayOrder: 6
    label: No patch
    description: 
     Flag to segment the image without using patches. The “no-patch” flag supersedes the “overlap” flag. 
     This option could potentially produce better results but may not be suitable with large images depending on computer RAM capacity.
    type: boolean
    defaultValue: false
  input_7:
    displayOrder: 7
    label: Verbosity
    description:
     Verbosity level for the segmentation. 
     Quiet Mode, shows minimal information on the Logger. 
     Developer Mode, shows more information on the Logger, useful for debugging.
    type: ref_contentSchema
    contentSchema: 
      title: Verbosity
      type: string
      default: Quiet Mode
      enum: [Quiet Mode, Developer Mode]
  input_8:
    displayOrder: 8
    label: Axon Shape
    description:
       Axon Shape to compute diamaters after the segmentation. 
       Circle, axon shape is considered as circle. In this case, diameter is computed using equivalent diameter. 
       Ellipse, axon shape is considered as an ellipse. In this case, diameter is computed using ellipse minor axis.
    type: ref_contentSchema
    contentSchema: 
      title: Verbosity
      type: string
      default: Circle
      enum: [Circle, Ellipse]
  input_9:
    displayOrder: 9
    label: Add Bounding Box
    description:
     Flag to extract additional bounding box information on axonmyelin objects. 
     Specifying this option will add a boolean value indicating if the axon touches one of the image border.
     It will also output every axon bounding box (including its myelin).
    type: boolean
    defaultValue: false

    label: Segmented image
    description: Archive containing the input image and images corresponding to the segmented axon and myelin
    type: data:*/*
